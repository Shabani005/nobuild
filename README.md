why use CMake, Make, Conan or all the other bs C builders when you can use C to build your project. it can even do ifdefs to account for different systems. I want my C code to depend on C. not on a shitty language that is not basically turing complete after all the bs they added (cough cough** cmake)  or python.. like why?? this is just begging for software to break at this point.
